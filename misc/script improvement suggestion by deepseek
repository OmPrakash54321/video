The script you've created is a solid foundation for benchmarking x264 encoder performance, but there are several improvements and considerations to ensure accurate performance measurement:

### Key Improvements Needed
1. **Resource Tracking Limitations**
   - Current CPU/memory tracking measures **total system usage** rather than per-process metrics. To track x264-specific resources:
   ```bash
   pidstat -p $PID 1 -u -h > cpu.log &
   pidstat -p $PID 1 -r -h > mem.log &
   ```
   - Consider using `perf stat` for cycle-level measurements:
   ```bash
   perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses x264 ... 
   ```

2. **Quality Metric Extraction**
   - Add log parsing to automatically extract PSNR/SSIM:
   ```bash
   awk '/PSNR/ {print $7}' "$log_path" >> psnr_results.csv
   awk '/SSIM/ {print $7}' "$log_path" >> ssim_results.csv
   ```

3. **Encoding Parameters Enhancement**
   - Add essential video quality controls:
   ```bash
   x264 --crf 23 --keyint 24 --bframes 3 --threads 4 ...
   ```
   - Include bitrate logging:
   ```bash
   awk '/kb\/s/ {print $8}' "$log_path" >> bitrate.log
   ```

### Critical Fixes Required
```bash
# In your x264 command, add these mandatory parameters:
x264 --input-res "$resolution" --fps "$fps" \
  --threads $(( $(nproc) / ch )) \
  ...
```
*(Missing resolution/fps specification could cause encoding errors)*

### Recommended Additions
- **Encoding Speed Measurement**
  ```bash
  time x264 ... 2>&1 | awk '/real/ {print $2}' >> encode_times.log
  ```
- **Hardware Consistency**
  ```bash
  # Set CPU governor to performance mode
  sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
  ```
- **Visual Quality Metrics**
  ```bash
  # Add VMAF calculation (requires FFmpeg)
  ffmpeg -i encoded.mp4 -i original.y4m -lavfi libvmaf -f null -
  ```

### Concurrency Management
For the channel-based parallel encoding:
```bash
# Use GNU Parallel for better job control
parallel -j $ch x264 --preset {1} ... ::: "${presets[@]}"
```

### Final Suggestions
1. Add warm-up runs (3-5 iterations) before actual measurements
2. Include multiple CRF/bitrate values for comprehensive analysis
3. Log system info (CPU, RAM, OS version) for reproducibility
4. Consider containerization (Docker) for environment consistency

The enhanced script would provide more accurate performance metrics while capturing both encoder efficiency and output quality characteristics. Would you like me to provide a revised version with these improvements implemented?
